	abstract = {A new radio frequency coil design for {NMR} experiments is presented. The coil generates a magnetic field purely perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the main magnet, and its sensitivity is higher than the traditional transversal resonators. This is achieved by adding the contribution of two tilted solenoid coils fed with opposite currents. The work presents the mathematical model for the new coil, numerical simulations performed to validate that model and a comparison with an equivalent saddle coil. The new design is tested experimentally in low- and high-field {NMR} experiments and compared with results obtained with equivalent saddle coils. The results lead to conclude that the new design provides better sensitivity than the transverse resonators commonly used in {NMR}.},

Measurements of spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) magnetic relaxation times were made in six normal tissues in the rat (muscle, kidney, stomach, intestine, brain, and liver) and in two malignant solid tumors, Walker sarcoma and Novikoff hepatoma. Relaxation times for the two malignant tumors were distinctly outside the range of values for the normal tissues studied, an indication that the malignant tissues were characterized by an increase in the motional freedom of tissue water molecules. The possibility of using magnetic relaxation methods for rapid discrimination between benign and malignant surgical specimens has also been considered. Spin-lattice relaxation times for two benign fibroadenomas were distinct from those for both malignant tissues and were the same as those of muscle.},

	abstract = {The bone marrow is one of the largest organs in the body and is visible in every magnetic resonance ({MR}) imaging study. It is composed of a combination of hematopoietic red marrow and fatty yellow marrow, and its composition changes throughout life in response to normal maturation (red to yellow conversion) and stress (yellow to red reconversion). {MR} imaging is highly sensitive for detection of altered marrow signal intensity, and the T1-weighted spin-echo sequence provides the most robust contrast between yellow marrow and disease. Heterogeneous red marrow and red marrow hyperplasia can mimic marrow disease, but should be distinguished from neoplastic replacement (leukemia, lymphoma, primary bone sarcomas, hematogenous metastases) and expected posttreatment changes (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, colony-stimulating factor, bone marrow transplant). Nonneoplastic edema-like processes can also alter marrow signal intensity, including trauma, infection, inflammation (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, juvenile inflammatory arthritis), altered biomechanics, and chronic regional pain syndrome. Unfortunately, {MR} imaging findings are often nonspecific and overlap among many of these vastly different causes. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis is reliant on a combination of imaging findings, clinical evaluation, laboratory assessment, and occasionally tissue analysis.©{RSNA}, 2016},

	abstract = {Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Second  Edition is a comprehensive and modern introduction which  focuses on those essential principles and concepts needed for a  thorough understanding of the subject, rather than the practical  aspects. The quantum theory of nuclear magnets is presented within  a strong physical framework, supported by figures.    The book assumes only a basic knowledge of complex numbers and  matrices, and provides the reader with numerous worked examples and  exercises to encourage understanding. With the explicit aim of  carefully developing the subject from the beginning, the text  starts with coverage of quarks and nucleons and progresses through  to a detailed explanation of several important {NMR} experiments,  including {NMR} imaging, {COSY}, {NOESY} and {TROSY}.   Completely revised and updated, the Second Edition features new  material on the properties and distributions of isotopes, chemical  shift anisotropy and quadrupolar interactions, Pake patterns, spin  echoes, slice selection in {NMR} imaging, and a complete new chapter  on the {NMR} spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. New appendices have  been included on Euler angles, and coherence selection by field  gradients. As in the first edition, all material is heavily  supported by graphics, much of which is new to this  edition.   Written for undergraduates and postgraduate students taking a  first course in {NMR} spectroscopy and for those needing an  up-to-date account of the subject, this multi-disciplinary book  will appeal to chemical, physical, material, life, medical, earth  and environmental scientists. The detailed physical insights will  also make the book of interest for experienced spectroscopists and  {NMR} researchers.   • An accessible and carefully written introduction,  designed to help students to fully understand this complex and  dynamic subject  • Takes a multi-disciplinary approach, focusing on basic  principles and concepts rather than the more practical aspects  • Presents a strong pedagogical approach throughout, with  emphasis placed on individual spins to aid understanding  • Includes numerous worked examples, problems, further  reading and additional notes  Praise from the reviews of the First Edition:  This is an excellent book... that many teachers of {NMR}  spectroscopy will cherish... It deserves to be a  ‘classic’ among {NMR} spectroscopy texts. {NMR}  {IN} {BIOMEDICINE}  I strongly recommend this book to everyone…it is  probably the best modern comprehensive description of the  subject. {ANGEWANDTE} {CHEMIE}, {INTERNATIONAL} {EDITION}},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) is a diagnostic technique used clinically in cardiology over the last ten years. It offers great advantages over other methods as it is noninvasive, does not use radiation, is tomographic and multiplanar. {MRI} is a very flexible technique based on the interaction between atomic nuclei, usually hydrogen, and external magnetic fields. This leads to image formation and to other important functional diagnostic information. {MRI} has undergone great technical developments and has proven to be most useful in several areas: cardiovascular structure; global and regional cardiac function; cardiovascular flow; coronary anatomy; myocardial perfusion and metabolism. The initial clinical diagnostic goals of {MRI} were mainly the anatomic characterization of aortic pathology, congenital heart disease, pericardium diseases and cardiac masses. With the development of cine {MRI} and, more recently, with rapid imaging and flow evaluation techniques, it has been increasingly used in the functional assessment of cardiovascular diseases. The functional study of the above mentioned clinical pathologies is now possible and information can also be obtained in other important areas; cardiac volumes and function; cardiovascular shunts, valvular heart disease; ischemic heart disease (ischemia detection, infarction quantification, coronary anatomy and flow). It also has an important role in myocardial characterization and is promising for myocardial metabolism, evaluated by spectroscopy. The goal of this review is the presentation of the main {MRI} techniques and the present clinical applications of this imaging method in cardiovascular diagnosis.},

By contrast, on general theoretical grounds it has been shown2 that the second moments of dipolar-broadened spectra should remain invariant and should not be reduced by such motion. In a recent explanation3 of this apparent discrepancy the nuclear magnetic interaction was divided into two parts, namely, a steady mean interaction and a fluctuating part. The steady mean interaction is less than the interaction in a static crystal devoid of hindered rotation and generates an observed spectrum narrower than that of the static crystal. The fluctuating part of the interaction generates side-spectra set at integral multiples of the frequency of molecular rotation on either side of the central narrowed spectrum. Since the molecules do not rotate uniformly, but are re-oriented with an irregular motion, these side-spectra are dispersed over a band of frequencies with an intensity too weak to be observed. It was shown, however3, that when these weak side-spectra are included the second moment does indeed remain invariant even though the second moment of the central portion, which is all that is observed experimentally, becomes smaller.},

Special {RF} pulse sequences, developed originally in solid state {NMR}, can be used to produce a spinning sideband-free isotropic spectrum. In this article the first results are shown of the brain, heart, liver, gluteus muscle, and kidney excised from mice using the 2D-phase-altered spinning sidebands ({PASS}) technique and employing {MAS} spinning speeds of 43–125 Hz. It was found that with slow sample spinning similar, and in some cases even better, spectral resolutions are obtained as compared with fast {MAS}. Magn Reson Med 46:88–94, 2001.

It should be possible to induce similar effects in a static sample if the direction of the magnetic field is varied, e.g., magic-angle rotation of the B0 field (B0-{MAS}). Here, this principle is experimentally demonstrated in a static sample of solid hyperpolarized xenon at ∼3.4mT. By extension to moderately high fields, it is possible to foresee interesting applications in situations where physical manipulation of the sample is inconvenient or impossible.

The magnet comprises a parallel pair of identical profiled arrays of permanent magnets backed by a flat steel yoke such that access in lateral directions is practical.

By analyzing the different sources of magnetic field perturbations present in a sample under {MAS} conditions, we propose a simple protocol to obtain optimum shim settings in {HRMAS}. In the case of aqueous samples, we show that the lock level cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the quality of the shims at high spinning speeds.

ABSTRACT = {Temperature changes play a large role in the day to day structural behavior of structures, but a smaller direct role in most contemporary Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) analyses. Temperature-Driven SHM will consider temperature as the principal driving force in SHM, relating a measurable input temperature to measurable output generalized strain (strain, curvature, etc.) and generalized displacement (deflection, rotation, etc.) to create three-dimensional signatures descriptive of the structural behavior. Identifying time periods of minimal thermal gradient provides the foundation for the formulation of the temperature–deformation–displacement model. Thermal gradients in a structure can cause curvature in multiple directions, as well as non-linear strain and stress distributions within the cross-sections, which significantly complicates data analysis and interpretation, distorts the signatures, and may lead to unreliable conclusions regarding structural behavior and condition. These adverse effects can be minimized if the signatures are evaluated at times when thermal gradients in the structure are minimal. This paper proposes two classes of methods based on the following two metrics: (i) the range of raw temperatures on the structure, and (ii) the distribution of the local thermal gradients, for identifying time periods of minimal thermal gradient on a structure with the ability to vary the tolerance of acceptable thermal gradients. The methods are tested and validated with data collected from the Streicker Bridge on campus at Princeton University.},

    abstract = { Before structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies can be reliably implemented on structures outside laboratory conditions, the problem of environmental variability in monitored features must be first addressed. Structures that are subjected to changing environmental or operational conditions will often exhibit inherently non-stationary dynamic and quasi-static responses, which can mask any changes caused by the occurrence of damage. The current work introduces the concept of cointegration, a tool for the analysis of non-stationary time series, as a promising new approach for dealing with the problem of environmental variation in monitored features. If two or more monitored variables from an SHM system are cointegrated, then some linear combination of them will be a stationary residual purged of the common trends in the original dataset. The stationary residual created from the cointegration procedure can be used as a damage-sensitive feature that is independent of the normal environmental and operational conditions. }

abstract = { This paper presents extensive temperature measurements obtained during a period of 4 years in an integral solid slab prestressed concrete bridge deck. There is very little experimental information available for this bridge typology. The quality of the measured temperature data are validated by comparing experimentally measured displacements at the ends of the bridge with theoretical displacements determined with the recorded temperature components. The measured temperatures are also compared with common design parameters made considering the specifications for thermal actions proposed by Eurocode 1. The results corroborate that the Eurocode 1 formulations are generally adequate to represent thermal actions on bridges; however, it may need to be complemented to define maximum and minimum temperatures for bridges in locations with daily temperature variations greater than 10°C. }

ABSTRACT = {The internal resistance is the key parameter for determining power, energy efficiency and lost heat of a lithium ion cell. Precise knowledge of this value is vital for designing battery systems for automotive applications. Internal resistance of a cell was determined by current step methods, AC (alternating current) methods, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and thermal loss methods. The outcomes of these measurements have been compared with each other. If charge or discharge of the cell is limited, current step methods provide the same results as energy loss methods.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present study an attempt has been made to investigate the relationship between the variations in the fouling assemblage and corrosion behaviour of HSLA steel at three coastal locations in the Gulf of Mannar, India, over a period of 24 months. Oyster fouling was dominant in the Tuticorin open sea, while barnacles were the major foulants in the Tuticorin harbour and Mandapam. The fouling load in the Tuticorin waters was higher when compared to the Mandapam waters. The corrosion rates decreased progressively with the immersion time at all three test locations. In the Tuticorin open sea, the corrosion rates were higher when compared to the other two locations throughout the study period. The surface of the coupons was characterized by crevices beneath the hard foulers in the Tuticorin harbour and Mandapam, whereas in the Tuticorin open sea, the coupons experienced crevices of a tunneling nature. The percentage of the loss of the tensile strength increased with time at all the test locations.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a time-dependent corrosion depth estimation method using atmospheric corrosion monitor (ACM) sensor data to evaluate time-dependent corrosion behaviors is proposed. For the time-dependent corrosion depth estimation of uncoated carbon steel and weathering steel, acceleration corrosion tests were conducted in salt-spray corrosion environments and evaluated with a corrosion damage estimation method using ACM sensing data and corrosion loss data of the tested steel specimens. To estimate the time-dependent corrosion depth using corrosion current by an ACM sensor, the relationship between the mean corrosion depth calculated from the weight loss method and the corrosion current was evaluated. The mean corrosion depth was estimated by calculating the corrosion current and evaluating the relationship between the mean corrosion depth and corrosion current during the expected period. From the test and estimation results, the corrosion current demonstrated a good linear correlation with the mean corrosion depth of carbon steel and weathering. The calculated mean corrosion depth is nearly the same as that of the tested specimen, which can be well used to estimate corrosion rate for the uncoated carbon steel and weathering steel.},

In municipal district heating, quality control may be improved by implementing on-line corrosion monitoring if a suitable technique can be identified to measure both uniform and localised corrosion. Electrochemical techniques (LPR, EIS, crevice corrosion current) as well as direct measurement techniques (high-sensitive electrical resistance, weight loss) have been applied in operating plants. Changes in the corrosion processes are best monitored in non-aggressive, low conductivity media with sensitive electrical resistance technique and crevice corrosion current measurements.}
