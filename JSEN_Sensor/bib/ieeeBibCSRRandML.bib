	ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed for material identification. It is based on the use of a microwave sensor array with the elements of the array resonating at various frequencies within a wide range and applying machine learning algorithms on the collected data. Unlike the previous microwave sensing systems which are mainly based on a single resonating sensor, the proposed methodology allows for material characterization over a wide frequency range which, in turn, improves the accuracy of the material identification procedure. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested via the use of easily available materials such as woods, cardboards, and plastics. However, the proposed methodology can be extended to other applications such as industrial liquid identification and composite material identification, among others.},

	ABSTRACT = {This research explores the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted approach to enhance the selectivity of microwave sensors used for liquid mixture sensing. We utilized a planar microwave sensor comprising two coupled rectangular complementary split-ring resonators operating at 2.45 GHz to establish a highly sensitive capacitive region. The sensor’s quality factor was markedly improved from 70 to approximately 2700 through the incorporation of a regenerative amplifier to compensate for losses. A deep neural network (DNN) technique is employed to characterize mixtures of methanol, ethanol, and water, using the frequency, amplitude, and quality factor as inputs. However, the DNN approach is found to be effective solely for binary mixtures, with a maximum concentration error of 4.3%. To improve selectivity for ternary mixtures, we employed a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm, the convolutional neural network (CNN), using the entire transmission response as the 1-D input. This resulted in a significant improvement in selectivity, limiting the maximum percentage error to just 0.7% (≈6-fold accuracy enhancement).},

	abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.}

	abstract = {Principal component analysis of a data matrix extracts the dominant patterns in the matrix in terms of a complementary set of score and loading plots. It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.}

	abstract = {Abstract Repeated double cross validation (rdCV) is a strategy for (a) optimizing the complexity of regression models and (b) for a realistic estimation of prediction errors when the model is applied to new cases (that are within the population of the data used). This strategy is suited for small data sets and is a complementary method to bootstrap methods. rdCV is a formal, partly new combination of known procedures and methods, and has been implemented in a function for the programming environment R, providing several types of plots for model evaluation. The current version of the software is dedicated to regression models obtained by partial least-squares (PLS). The applied methods for repeated splits of the data into test sets and calibration sets, as well as for estimation of the optimum number of PLS components, are described. The relevance of some parameters (number of segments in CV, number of repetitions) is investigated. rdCV is applied to two data sets from chemistry: (1) determination of glucose concentrations from near infrared (NIR) data in mash samples from bioethanol production; (2) modeling the gas chromatographic retention indices of polycyclic aromatic compounds from molecular descriptors. Models using all original variables and models using a small subset of the variables, selected by a genetic algorithm (GA), are compared by rdCV. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

	abstract = {Variable selection is one of the important practical issues for many scientific engineers. Although the PLS (partial least squares) regression combined with the VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores is often used when the multicollinearity is present among variables, there are few guidelines about its uses as well as its performance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the VIP method and to compare with other methods through computer simulation experiments. We design 108 experiments where observations are generated from true models considering four factors–the proportion of the number of relevant predictors, the magnitude of correlations between predictors, the structure of regression coefficients, and the magnitude of signal to noise. Confusion matrix is adopted to evaluate the performance of PLS, the Lasso, and stepwise method. We also discuss the proper cutoff value of the VIP method to increase its performance. Some practical hints for the use of the VIP method are given as simulation results.}
