Based on the emission data resulting from olfactometric surveys conducted in different periods of the year the overall odour emission rate emitted by each plant were evaluated, showing that the major contributor to the odour impact on the territory was plant 2. These data were linked with meteorological and orographical data in order to evaluate odour dispersion with a model (Calpuff). The results of the odour dispersion modelling confirmed the outcomes of the olfactometric survey and they were further validated through a “questioning” survey, conducted with the aim of involving the population by means of questionnaires for reporting the perceived odour episodes, which showed a good correspondence (86.5%) between odour perceptions and simulated odour immissions.}

Quantification of odor emissions in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is key to minimize odor impact to surrounding communities. Odor measurements in WWTPs are usually performed via either expensive and discontinuous olfactometry hydrogen sulfide detectors or via fixed electronic noses. We propose a portable lightweight electronic nose specially designed for real-time odor monitoring in WWTPs using small drones. The so-called RHINOS e-nose allows odor measurements with high spatial resolution, and its accuracy is only slightly worse than that of dynamic olfactometry. The device has been calibrated using odor samples collected in a WWTP in Spain over a period of six months and validated in the same WWTP three weeks after calibration. The promising results obtained support the suitability of the proposed instrument to identify the odor sources having the highest emissions, which may give a useful indication to the plant managers as regards odor control and abatement.}

ABSTRACT = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are sources of greenhouse gases, hazardous air pollutants and offensive odors. These emissions can have negative repercussions in and around the plant, degrading the quality of life of surrounding neighborhoods, damaging the environment, and reducing employee’s overall job satisfaction. Current monitoring methodologies based on fixed gas detectors and sporadic olfactometric measurements (human panels) do not allow for an accurate spatial representation of such emissions. In this paper we use a small drone equipped with an array of electrochemical and metal oxide (MOX) sensors for mapping odorous gases in a mid-sized WWTP. An innovative sampling system based on two (10 m long) flexible tubes hanging from the drone allowed near-source sampling from a safe distance with negligible influence from the downwash of the drone’s propellers. The proposed platform is very convenient for monitoring hard-to-reach emission sources, such as the plant’s deodorization chimney, which turned out to be responsible for the strongest odor emissions. The geo-localized measurements visualized in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) gas concentration map revealed the main emission hotspots where abatement solutions were needed. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the multivariate sensor signals suggests that the proposed system can also be used to trace which emission source is responsible for a certain measurement.},

Although the PLS (partial least squares) regression combined with the VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores is often used when the multicollinearity is present among variables, there are few guidelines about its uses as well as its performance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the VIP method and to compare with other methods through computer simulation experiments. We design 108 experiments where observations are generated from true models considering four factors–the proportion of the number of relevant predictors, the magnitude of correlations between predictors, the structure of regression coefficients, and the magnitude of signal to noise. Confusion matrix is adopted to evaluate the performance of PLS, the Lasso, and stepwise method. We also discuss the proper cutoff value of the VIP method to increase its performance. Some practical hints for the use of the VIP method are given as simulation results.}

abstract = {Abstract Repeated double cross validation (rdCV) is a strategy for (a) optimizing the complexity of regression models and (b) for a realistic estimation of prediction errors when the model is applied to new cases (that are within the population of the data used). This strategy is suited for small data sets and is a complementary method to bootstrap methods. rdCV is a formal, partly new combination of known procedures and methods, and has been implemented in a function for the programming environment R, providing several types of plots for model evaluation. The current version of the software is dedicated to regression models obtained by partial least-squares (PLS). The applied methods for repeated splits of the data into test sets and calibration sets, as well as for estimation of the optimum number of PLS components, are described. The relevance of some parameters (number of segments in CV, number of repetitions) is investigated. rdCV is applied to two data sets from chemistry: (1) determination of glucose concentrations from near infrared (NIR) data in mash samples from bioethanol production; (2) modeling the gas chromatographic retention indices of polycyclic aromatic compounds from molecular descriptors. Models using all original variables and models using a small subset of the variables, selected by a genetic algorithm (GA), are compared by rdCV. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The sensitivity and selectivity of metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors change significantly when the sensors operate at different temperatures. While previous investigations have presented systematic approaches to optimize the operating temperature of a single MOX sensor, in this paper we present a methodology to select the optimal operating temperature of all the MOX sensors constituent of a gas sensor array based on the multivariate response of all the sensing elements. Our approach estimates a widely used Information Theory measure, the so-called Mutual Information (MI), which quantifies the amount of information that the state of one random variable (response of the gas sensor array) can provide from the state of another random variable representing the gas quality. More specifically, our methodology builds sensor models from experimental data to solve the technical problem of populating the joint probability distribution for the MI estimation. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by maximizing the MI and selecting the best operating temperatures of a four-sensor array sampled at 94 different temperatures to optimize the discrimination task of ethanol, acetic acid, 2-butanone, and acetone. In addition to being applicable in principle to sensor arrays of any size, our approach gives precise information on the ability of the system to discriminate odors according to the temperature of the MOX sensors, for either the optimal set of temperatures or the temperatures that may render inefficient operation of the system itself.}

This study used a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model for the flow characteristics and velocity distribution of the downwash airflow generated by a quadrotor plant protection UAV at different flight velocities (1$∼$5$m/s$) was established. The measurement tests for airflow velocity distribution inside the canopies were conducted. The results indicated that the spiral vortices appeared below the rotors and then evolved into inclined horseshoe vortices. The horseshoe vortices at the flight velocity of 5$m/s$ exceeded the flight height of the UAV and tended to cause droplet drift. When the flight velocity was larger than 4$m/s$, it was difficult for the horseshoe vortex to enter the bottom of the canopy, which was not conducive to improving the droplet penetration performance. The diffusion and attenuation of the horseshoe vortex during the flow process led to an increase and then a decrease in the velocity distribution area in the Z-direction of airflow. In order to improve the droplet penetration performance, the optimal operating distance range between UAV and canopy was given when the flight velocity was less than 3$m/s based on the variation law of the velocity distribution in the Z-direction. The validation results showed that the simulated and measured values maintained the same trend.}

In this study, three possible ways to reduce these emissions are discussed and analyzed: (1) minimization through the change of operational conditions, (2) treatment of the gaseous streams, and (3) prevention by applying new configurations and processes to remove both organic matter and pollutants. In current WWTPs, to modify the operational conditions of existing units reveals itself as possibly the most economical way to decrease N2O and CO2 emissions without deterioration of effluent quality. Nowadays the treatment of the gaseous streams containing the GHG seems to be a not suitable option due to the high capital costs of systems involved to capture and clean them. The change of WWTP configuration by using microalgae or partial nitritation-Anammox processes to remove ammonia from wastewater, instead of conventional nitrification-denitrification processes, can significantly reduce the GHG emissions and the energy consumed. However, the area required in the case of microalgae systems and the current lack of information about stability of partial nitritation-Anammox processes operating in the main stream of the WWTP are factors to be considered.},

abstract = {Objectives
The Bland and Altman limits of agreement (LoA) method is almost universally used to compare two measurement methods, when the outcome is continuous. The method relies on strong statistical assumptions, which are unlikely to hold in practice. Given the popularity of this simple method, it is timely to explain when it can be safely used and when it should not be used.
Study Design and Settings
Based on a small sample of simulated data where the truth is known, we illustrate what happens when the LoA method is used and the underlying assumptions are violated.
Results
When each measurement method has a different precision or the systematic difference between the two methods is not constant, the LoA method should not be used. For this setting, we refer to an alternative unbiased statistical method, which comes at the cost of having to gather repeated measurements by at least one of the two measurement methods.
Conclusion
The LoA method is valid under very restrictive conditions and when these conditions do not hold the only way out is to gather repeated measurements by at least one of the two measurement methods and use an alternative existing statistical methodology.}
